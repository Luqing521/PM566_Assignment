| 33043110 | EXPLORING SURFACE GLYCOPROTEIN TO DESIGN MULTI-EPITOPE VACCINE AGAINST COVID-19.  | Stimulation and generation of T and B cell mediated long-term immune response is essential for the curbing of a deadly virus such as SAR-CoV-2. Immunoinformatics approach in vaccine design takes advantage of antigenic and non-allergenic epitopes present on the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to elicit immune responses. T cells and B cells epitopes were predicted, and the selected residues were subjected to allergenicity, antigenicity and toxicity screening which were linked by appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope subunit vaccine. The physiochemical properties of the vaccine construct was analyzed and the molecular weight, molecular formula, theoretical isoelectric point value, half-life, solubility score, instability index, aliphatic index and GRAVY were predicted. The vaccine structure was constructed, refined, validated, and disulfide engineered to get the best model. Molecular binding simulation and molecular dynamics simulation were carried out to predict the stability and binding affinity of the vaccine construct with TLRs. Codon acclimatization and in silico cloning were performed to confirm the vaccine expression and potency. Results obtained indicated that this novel vaccine candidate is non-toxic, capable of initiating the immunogenic response and will not induce an allergic reaction. The highest binding energy was observed in TLR 4 (-1398.1) and the least is TLR 2 (-1479. 6). The steady rise in Th (helper) cell population with memory development was noticed and IFN-g was provoked after simulation. At this point, the vaccine candidate awaits animal trial to validate its efficacy and safety for use in the prevention of the novel COVID-19 infections. © 2020 The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Informatics in medicine unlocked | 2020 Oct 04 |
| 33042591 | Impact of COVID-19 on clinical trials and clinical research: A systematic review. | Background: The World Health Organization has reported more than 31,186,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), including 962,343 deaths, worldwide as on September 21, 2020. The current COVID-19 pandemic is affecting clinical research activities in most parts of the world. The focus on developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and the treatment of COVID-19 is, in fact, disrupting many upcoming and/or ongoing clinical trials on other diseases around the globe. On March 18, 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an updated guideline for the conduct of clinical trials during the current health emergency situation. The potential challenges, such as social distancing and quarantines, result in study participants’ inaccessibility and trial personnel for in-person scheduled study visits and/or follow-up. Due to the sudden onset and wide-spread impact of COVID-19, its influence on the management of clinical trials and research necessitates urgent attention. Therefore, our systematic review of the literature aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the conduction of clinical trials and research. The search for the relevant articles for review included the keywords “COVID-19” AND “clinical trial” in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Google scholar and Google electronic databases. Key findings include: delaying subject enrollment and operational gaps in most ongoing clinical trials, which in turn has a negative impact on trial programmes and data integrity. Globally, most sites conducting clinical trials other than COVID-19 are experiencing a delay in timelines and a complete halt of operations in lieu of this pandemic, thus affecting clinical research outcomes. © 2020 CEA& INEA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Nepal journal of epidemiology    | 2020 Sep    |
| 33038433 | COVID-19: discovery, diagnostics and drug development.                            | An epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome (Covid-19) started in humans in Wuhan in 2019, and became a pandemic. Groups from China Identified and sequenced the virus responsible for COVID-19, named SARS-CoV-2, and determined that it was a novel coronavirus (CoV) that shared high sequence identity with bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-like CoVs, suggesting a zoonotic origin. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of vertebrates. The rapid release of the sequence of the virus has allowed the development of diagnostic tools (e.g., RT-PCR). Additionally, serological tests can allow identification of persons who have been infected. In humans, CoVs tend to cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections. The fatality rate is around 1-3% for infected persons. An acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to an uncontrolled immune activation (“cytokine storm”) occurs in patients with severe disease and poor prognosis. Risk factors for mortality include: advanced age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and other comorbidities. Drug repurposing has been used to rapidly identify potential treatment for COVID-19, which could move quickly to phase-3. Better knowledge of the virus, its enzymes, will be mandatory to develop more potent and specific direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA). In the long term, a vaccine to prevent infection would be crucial; however even if successful it might not be available before 2021-22. To date, with the exception of intravenous Remdesivir and dexamethasone, which have modest effects in moderate to severe COVID-19, no strong clinical evidence supports the efficacy and safety of any other drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to provide insights on the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, its virology, the diagnostic tools, and the ongoing drug discovery effort.
